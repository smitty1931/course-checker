                <name>Neurobiology of Behaviour</name>
                <description>this neuroscience course focuses on higher brain functions and the mechanisms underlying human and animal behaviours. topics may include the emerging role of the gut microbiome's impact on behaviour, pathogens that alter neuronal development and the biological basis of mindfulness and placebos. in addition, the impact that exercise and sleep play in modulating these behaviours are examined. common experimental techniques used in neuroscience research such as brain imaging and cellular genetics are emphasized.</description>
